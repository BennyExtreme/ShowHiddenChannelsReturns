[DevilBro](https://github.com/mwittrien "ShowHiddenChannels plugin author"), author of this plugin, and BetterDiscord developers
have deleted ShowHiddenChannels plugin from the official BetterDiscord site >:C.

But this plugin still can be found in the commit history of their repository! Proof: (They removed a few lines from the config file that
were needed to plugin's work. Without them it just doesn't work even if you install the previous version from their repository)

and follow the short instructions below.

## Installation ##
1) Download and extract the files.
2) Drop «ShowHiddenChannelsReturns.plugin.js» into your plugin folder.
3) Run Discord.
